# Chatr-SocialApp
This repository contains the backend code for a social app named "chatr", which allows users to post and comment on different topics. The backend is built using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. For unit testing, Jest is used. This codebase likely includes routes for handling user authentication and authorization, database models for storing and retrieving user data, and possibly real-time functionality for the post and comment feature of the app. It also includes business logic for creating, reading, updating and deleting post and comment.
